This publication of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
("OFAC") is designed as a reference tool providing actual notice of
actions by OFAC with respect to Specially Designated Nationals and
other entities whose property is blocked, to assist the public in
complying with the various sanctions programs administered by OFAC.
The latest changes may appear here prior to their publication in the
Federal Register, and it is intended that users rely on changes
indicated in this document that post-date the most recent Federal
Register publication with respect to a particular sanctions program
in the appendices to chapter V of Title 31, Code of Federal
Regulations.  Such changes reflect official actions of OFAC, and
will be reflected as soon as practicable in the Federal Register
under the index heading "Foreign Assets Control."  New Federal
Register notices with regard to Specially Designated Nationals or
blocked entities may be published at any time.  Users are advised to
check the Federal Register and this electronic publication routinely
for additional names or other changes to the listings. Entities and
individuals on the list are occasionally licensed by OFAC to
transact business with U.S. persons in anticipation of removal from
the list or because of foreign policy considerations in unique
circumstances.  Licensing in anticipation of official Federal
Register publication of a notice of removal based on the unblocking
of an entity's or individual's property is reflected in this
publication by removal from the list.  Current information on
licenses issued with regard to Specially Designated Nationals and
other blocked persons may be obtained or verified by calling OFAC
Licensing at 202/622-2480.  The following changes have occurred with
respect to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Listing of Specially
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons since January 1, 2011:
